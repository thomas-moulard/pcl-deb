.SH OPTIONS

Syntax is: pcl_compute_cloud_error source.pcd target.pcd output_intensity.pcd <options>
  where options are:
                     -correspondence X = the way of selecting the corresponding pair in the target cloud for the current point in the source cloud
                                         options are: index = points with identical indices are paired together. Note: both clouds need to have the same number of points
                                                      nn = source point is paired with its nearest neighbor in the target cloud
                                                      nnplane = source point is paired with its projection on the plane determined by the nearest neighbor in the target cloud. Note: target cloud needs to contain normals
                                         (default: index)
